// BST: Contains
// Create a contains(val) method on BST that returns whether the tree contains a given value. Take advantage of the BST structure to make this a much more rapid operation than SList.contains() would be.



// BST: Min
// Create a min() method on the BST class that returns the smallest value found in the BST.



// BST: Max
// Create a max() BST method that returns the largest value contained in the binary search tree.



// BST: Size
// Write a size() method that returns the number of nodes (values) contained in the tree.



// BST: Is Empty
// Create an isEmpty() method to return whether the BST is empty (whether it contains no values).
